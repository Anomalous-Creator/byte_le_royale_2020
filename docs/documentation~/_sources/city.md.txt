# City
Your city is what you must protect against disasters. It houses several important stats that stand between you and GAME OVER, Population and Structure. Once population reaches zero, your city falls and it's game over. Structure acts as your population's max cap, so if your structure reaches zero, so does your population. You can protect your city by having the correct [decrees](decrees.html), upgrading [buildings](buildings.html), and by allocating [effort](effort.html) to `ActionType.regain_population` and `ActionType.repair_structure`.



Has different types of cities:
    healthy, sturdy, invested, pyrophobic, popular, modern

Healthy: Starts with population already up to structure, giving your city a headstart in allocating effort
Sturdy: Starts with structure up to max structure, allowing you to focus on population.
Invested: Start with 1500 gold.
Pyrophobic: Upgrades the fire sensor to level 1. 
Popular: Upgrades the population booster building to level 1.
Modern: Upgrades the city to level one. 

Can be upgraded to increase structure.
Initial MAX structure: 200
