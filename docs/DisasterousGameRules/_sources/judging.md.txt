# Judging

## Competition End and Submission

* All submissions must be in by 6:30 PM Saturday evening
* Judging will commence after this submission deadline

## Procedure

* A series of games will be generated
* Every team's client that submitted prior to the deadline will be run through each game
* The games generated will not change between clients, so each client will be facing the same events on the same turns as every other client to ensure fairness (if you get hit by 3 UFO's on turn 20, so will everyone else)
* Each client's scores (in turns survived) for each game will be recorded
* The average of the mean and median score for each client will be calculated (mean + median / 2)
* Whichever team has the highest averaged score will win!
* IN THE CASE OF A TIE: Highest overall score is tiebreaker

## We wish you the best of luck
