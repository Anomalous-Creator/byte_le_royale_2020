# IntroductionWelcome to Disaster Dispatcher! Your goal: survive. You are in charge of this unfortunate city that tends to be hit by many, many natural disasters (and some unnatural ones). Every turn, you'll have the opportunity to divvy up your city's population in order to prepare against or counteract any disasters that are working to destroy your city. You'll also be in charge of setting a mayoral decree that will reduce the impact of disasters, if you are able to predict them correctly. Fortunately, you can use the city to your advantage: there are sensors that will help you predict which disasters are incoming. There is room in your city for special side buildings that can be built to provide bonus effects. Finally, you can invest in growing your city to increase the maximum amount of people can be a citizen.Now be careful, if your city runs out of structure or population, you lose! Good luck!
