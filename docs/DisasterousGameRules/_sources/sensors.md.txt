# Sensors
Sensors enable you to predict [disasters](disasters.html) before they happen. Correctly guessing which disaster will happen next can allow you to choose the correct [decree](decrees.html). There is a sensor for every disaster, and each one must be upgraded individually. 

However, weather can be difficult to predict. The likelihood that certain disasters will occur will not be completely accurate. You can upgrade your sensors by allocating [effort](effort.html) to the sensor. Upgrading your sensor will make the sensor more accurate by decreasing the range up and down that it can be wrong.
