# Decrees
Decrees are your first line of defense against disasters. When an instant disaster happens and the corresponding decree is selected, the damage is halved. When a lasting disaster happens and the corresponding decree is selected, the effort required to clear the disaster is halved. Some [buildings](buildings.html) boost the effectiveness of decrees, and upgrading your sensors will improve your ability to guess the upcoming disaster.

Note that the decree must be active *before* the disaster occurs to count as a correct decree.
