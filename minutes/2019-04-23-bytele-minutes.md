#Bytele Notes### 2019-04-23## What we went over### Game reviews- Three remaining games:	- Disaster Dispatcher Mk II	- S.W.A.T. Bops	- Sander's Pirate Game- Disaster Dispatcher Mk II	- Pros		- Could have a decent amount of strategy involved w/ climates?		- Variety in approach to solve with prior years.		- Cities!		- Both cons potentially cancel each other out.		- Easy to test?		- Minimalist, requires more gameplay concepts		- Easy to judge	- Cons		- Random elements can mean random winner (-can be countered)		- Not diverse enough/could be easily solvable x4 (-Plenty of time?)		- Deciding on sensors to buy boils down to becoming a numbers game to players, might take away enjoyability (-Not necessarily)		- Few elements make it difficult for players to divvy up work		- Minimalist, requires more gameplay concepts		- Requires extra effort to make interesting visually (-Ticker tape idea?)- S.W.A.T. Bops	- Pros		- Unique game idea x2		- Different body parts = lots of strategies to consider		- Somewhat easy concept for beginners		- qualification point system finds easy leaderboard generation		- Robots!!! =D		- great meme name potential		- Easy to divvy up work	- Cons		- Crux of the game's difficulty lies in communication with the teammate rather than strategy. (-Can have some form of coarse comms)		- Difficult for competitors to test.; may need to program 2 AI (-can be shipped w/ basic AI and can run w/ own as well)		- fighting games are very technical/numbers game (-yes:metas)		- Different body parts could be inherently better than others (-requires fine balancing)		- 2v2 means server work =( x2 (-we'll burn that bridge when we get to it)		- May need to run (many many)x5 games (-matchmaking)		- Gameplay may be programmed to be generic to avoid problems w/ using different legs/arms (-balancing)- Sander's Pirate Game	- Pros		- Pirates!!		- decision tree easy to implement and be "AI"		- A similar game to BR '18 means we have a similar game to compare/guide new board		- LOTS of potential to be added		- Dungeon Delvers was a good competition format, and few competitors will have seen both	- Cons		- Potentially similar to Dungeon Delvers		- Lots of small tidbits to program		- LOTS of potential to be added, could get too complicated quickly a la BR'19		- Very abstract idea as of now, lots to consider
