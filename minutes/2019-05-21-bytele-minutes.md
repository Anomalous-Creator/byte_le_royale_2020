Progressive action		- b. Reactionary measure	- Preemptive action (Decrees)		- a. "Preventative"- Population Control	- work in numbers versus percentage		- numbers would be better, to avoid floating point errors- order of actions	- preemptive action/decree doesn't matter when you input it	- deciding on how much pop does what matters because player may allocate more population than they have- work_on_effort(action, people) versus work_on_fire(people)- Converting Disasters to Object	- makes it easier to track individual disasters and have multiple disasters occurring simultaneously- Class Action	- actions.add method can differentiate between types of input, such as sensor, disaster, accumulate_wealth, etc.- Class Disaster	- create objects of current disasters kept together in list
