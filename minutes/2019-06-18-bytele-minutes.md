#Bytele Notes### 2019-06-18## What we went over### Previous Work- Spencer	- Added city class	- reordered enums to be alphabetical	- added SCP foundation as monster sensor	- assigned himself to issue #6 - Riley	- serialization and deserialization		- deserialization is much harder than expected		- implemented an object to parse the logs	- visualizer work		- extremely basic functionality			- true disaster odds are only information shown		- pip environment is setup			- Pipfile and Pipfile.lock	- Assets folder- Wyly	- Batch files added		- debug\_generate and debug\_run 			- same as generate and run, except pauses on errors	- suite runner		- runs all test cases	- visualizer update		- allows for forward and backward movement### Game Discussion- Visualizer ideas	- City health bar and population bar at very bottom- Location vs Type	- Location gives the impression some disasters are less/more likely to occur	- Type better encompasses the bonus effect	- Moon => moon shoes = bad	- volcano => shovel that lava- damage numbers	- floating	- very intensive at making numbers disappear- City day night cycle
